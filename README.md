# OWL Leveled List Addition
Allows you to patch your entire modlist to add weapons and armors to Open World Loot leveled lists automatically, based on keywords.
Obviously, the main mod is required for this!

Note that this mod does not conflict with the already existing patcher for OWL! It complements it, and you should use both!

Automatically able to create sublists for mods that have more than a certain amount of items, so as not to overload OWL leveled lists.

Settings:
-Populate Armour leveled lists: will populate both weapons AND armours into relevant OWL leveled lists. True by default, but you may want this off.

-Maximum items per mod for sublist:  If a mod has more than this number of items to be added to one of OWL's leveled lists, a new sublist will be created and added instead.
If you encounter errors saying that a leveled list is over the max of 256 items in one leveled list, you can lower the settings for maximum items per mod. This will allow creating more sublists, and won't bloat the OWL leveled lists.

-debug: Leave it off, it's just for me to display some additional information.


IF YOU DON"T WANT A SPECIFIC MOD TO BE INCLUDED: blacklist the mod from the synthesis group.


Note: should you be dissatisfied with this patcher's results, you could still make use of it to create a patch for single mods. Only load OWL and this one mod, and run the synthesis patcher on it. You can then rename the created ESP and tweak it in xEdit to your liking.
